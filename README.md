### Hi there 👋

- 🧐 I’m a freelance front-end developer in Paris, France.
- 🛠 I work on front-end development, plugins & themes for WordPress, and Magento 1 & 2 Front-End development.
- 🗓 I’m doing one open-source commit a day since a long time, so that's why my contribution graph is full. [Learn more 🇫🇷](https://medium.com/@Darklg/2500-jours-sur-github-ddaf94aea280).
- 🔗 Have a look at [my portfolio](https://www.kevin-rocher.fr/) or my [WordPress Plugins](https://github.com/WordPressUtilities).
